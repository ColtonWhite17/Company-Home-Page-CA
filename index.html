    <section id="about">
      <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
    <p>
  Founded in <strong>2023</strong>, Muscle-Builder Meal Prep was born out of a shared vision
  to redefine the way people approach nutrition.
</p>
<p> Our journey began when a
        group of culinary enthusiasts and nutrition experts came together,
        united by a belief that eating well shouldn't be a luxury, but a
        lifestyle accessible to all. </p>
    

      <p>
        With backgrounds ranging from professional chefs to registered
        dietitians, our team embarked on a mission to create a culinary haven
        where flavor, health, and convenience harmoniously coexist. We set out
        to craft meals that inspire joy and nourishment, helping our community
        embrace a healthier, happier way of living.

        meticulously designed to cater to a variety of dietary needs and
        preferences.

        We're committed to elevating the art of meal prep. Our chefs infuse
        creativity into every dish, transforming traditional favorites into
        nutritious delights. With a focus on balance, portion control, and
